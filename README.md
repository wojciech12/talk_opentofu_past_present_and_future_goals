# OpenTofu - past, present, and future goals

The goal of the talk is to present to you the OpenTofu project. I will tell you about the project's beginnings â€” the license change, the manifesto, the fork, and joining the Linux Foundation. Next, we will discuss the OpenTofu goals, what we have achieved so far, and our plans for the upcoming months. Finally, I will share where to find us and how to join the project. We will close the talk with a Q&A session.
